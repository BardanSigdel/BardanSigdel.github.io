## üìä Projects

### CRM Migration Data Reconciliation Project

After a pivotal acquisition, I was tasked with spearheading a large-scale CRM migration. The intricacies of this migration demanded a deep dive into vast amounts of unstructured textual data. By harnessing the power of advanced textual analytics, I meticulously parsed and analyzed this sea of information. I employed hierarchical clustering algorithms to decipher the underlying patterns and structures in the data, which enabled me to effectively quantify various data attributes. This analytical depth uncovered hidden data loss patterns, insights that were instrumental in informing our migration strategy.

Furthermore, I recognized the opportunity to refine our data architecture. Drawing on the insights from the migration process, I proposed and facilitated the development of hybrid data marts. These new infrastructures enhanced our data retrieval and analysis capabilities, providing the organization with a more robust and agile data ecosystem. What made this project particularly remarkable was the tight timeline. Despite the complexity and scale, I successfully navigated these challenges and delivered actionable recommendations within a mere 2 months. The resulting infrastructure not only facilitated the seamless integration of the acquired CRM data but also set the stage for more streamlined and insightful data operations in the future.

### Helen of Troy - Predictive Analysis
Executed a predictive analysis for Helen of Troy's Health & Home division, analyzing the sales patterns of products under the Vicks & Braun portfolios in correlation with seasonal changes. Developed data-driven models to comprehend customer preferences, purchase patterns, and to formulate optimized product strategies. Advanced analytics and predictive modeling tools were leveraged to derive geographical demand curves and spot early indicators of demand trends during illness seasons.

### Risk Analysis Project for The Bullet Co.
Drafted an exhaustive business risk asssessment report for a Denver-based startup, building an avant-garde ‚Äúsmart‚Äù electronic mixed drink shaker intended to reshape the mixology domain by fusing advanced technology with contemporary design. To underpin the viability and potential of The Bullet, I implemented an array of risk assessment tools and techniques. Monte Carlo simulations were executed to understand potential financial outcomes, while sensitivity analyses identified key variables influencing the product's profitability. Extensive market research analytics, combined with SWOT and PESTEL analyses, provided a holistic view of the product's positioning in the marketplace. This multi-faceted approach ensured comprehensive risk mitigation strategies were in place, thus bolstering investor confidence. Prototype design software further aided in the visualization and iterative refinement of the product, while financial modeling tools facilitated the accurate projection of ROI and market demand.

### Daniels MSBA Housing Analysis
Utilized multivariate regression modeling to analyze housing prices in King County, WA and Denver County, CO. Advised the board of strategic development, confirming that housing prices were majorly influenced by square footage of living spaces, housing grade, and waterfront setting. Python and SPSS Modeler were extensively used to derive these insights.

### English Premier League Exploration using Python
Conducted an in-depth data analysis to explore the correlation between club expenditure and success in the English Premier League since 1992. Utilizing Python for data exploration and statistical software for correlation analyses, the findings showcased a robust positive correlation between club expenditure and success. Additional geospatial analyses were performed to understand club location's influence on success, suggesting further research avenues.
