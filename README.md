## üìä Consultancy Projects

### CRM Migration Data Reconciliation Project

After a pivotal acquisition, I was tasked with spearheading a large-scale CRM migration. The intricacies of this migration demanded a deep dive into vast amounts of unstructured textual data. By harnessing the power of advanced textual analytics, I meticulously parsed and analyzed this sea of information. I employed hierarchical clustering algorithms to decipher the underlying patterns and structures in the data, which enabled me to effectively quantify various data attributes. This analytical depth uncovered hidden data loss patterns, insights that were instrumental in informing our migration strategy.

Furthermore, I recognized the opportunity to refine our data architecture. Drawing on the insights from the migration process, I proposed and facilitated the development of hybrid data marts. These new infrastructures enhanced our data retrieval and analysis capabilities, providing the organization with a more robust and agile data ecosystem. What made this project particularly remarkable was the tight timeline. Despite the complexity and scale, I successfully navigated these challenges and delivered actionable recommendations within a mere 2 months. The resulting infrastructure not only facilitated the seamless integration of the acquired CRM data but also set the stage for more streamlined and insightful data operations in the future.

### Helen of Troy - Predictive Analysis
Executed a predictive analysis for Helen of Troy's Health & Home division, analyzing the sales patterns of products under the Vicks & Braun portfolios in correlation with seasonal changes. Developed data-driven models to comprehend customer preferences, purchase patterns, and to formulate optimized product strategies. Advanced analytics and predictive modeling tools were leveraged to derive geographical demand curves and spot early indicators of demand trends during illness seasons.
